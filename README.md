# Audio-YouTube-Shorts-Make.com-
Upload long-form audio and get captioned, on-brand 9:16 YouTube Shorts—auto-titled, scheduled, logged, and alert-monitored. Built in Make.com with Google Drive, Google Sheets, and YouTube Data modules.  Why this exists: creators and teams spend hours clipping, captioning, titling, and uploading. This pipeline turns that into a background task.
